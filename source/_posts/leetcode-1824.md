There is a **3 lane road** of length `n` that consists of `n + 1` **points** labeled from `0` to `n`. A frog **starts** at point `0` in the **second** lane and wants to jump to point `n`. However, there could be obstacles along the way.

You are given an array `obstacles` of length `n + 1` where each `obstacles[i]` (**ranging from 0 to 3**) describes an obstacle on the lane `obstacles[i]` at point `i`. If `obstacles[i] == 0`, there are no obstacles at point `i`. There will be **at most one** obstacle in the 3 lanes at each point.

- For example, if `obstacles[2] == 1`, then there is an obstacle on lane 1 at point 2.

The frog can only travel from point `i` to point `i + 1` on the same lane if there is not an obstacle on the lane at point `i + 1`. To avoid obstacles, the frog can also perform a **side jump** to jump to **another** lane (even if they are not adjacent) at the **same** point if there is no obstacle on the new lane.

- For example, the frog can jump from lane 3 at point 3 to lane 1 at point 3.

Return *the **minimum number of side jumps** the frog needs to reach **any lane** at point n starting from lane `2` at point 0.*

**Note:** There will be no obstacles on points `0` and `n`.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/25/ic234-q3-ex1.png)

```
Input: obstacles = [0,1,2,3,0]
Output: 2 
Explanation: The optimal solution is shown by the arrows above. There are 2 side jumps (red arrows).
Note that the frog can jump over obstacles only when making side jumps (as shown at point 2).
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/25/ic234-q3-ex2.png)

```
Input: obstacles = [0,1,1,3,3,0]
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no obstacles on lane 2. No side jumps are required.
```

**Example 3:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/25/ic234-q3-ex3.png)

```
Input: obstacles = [0,2,1,0,3,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: The optimal solution is shown by the arrows above. There are 2 side jumps.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `obstacles.length == n + 1`
- `1 <= n <= 5 * 105`
- `0 <= obstacles[i] <= 3`
- `obstacles[0] == obstacles[n] == 0`

## solutions

I got stuck in this question for nearly whole day. I repeatedly try to figure out the exact transformation of states and omit that I can use **mod** to refer to positions. Finally, the function is quite simple. `DP[i][j] = dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i - 1][j], Math.min(dp[i - 1][(j + 1) % 3] + 1, dp[i - 1][(j + 2) % 3] + 1))` The key thing is that, **if their is a stone in place `dp[i][j]`, we can not use the value in `dp[i - 1][j]` to deduce the value at line dp[i]**
``` Java
class Solution {
    int inf = Integer.MAX_VALUE - 1;
    int[][] dp;
    public int minSideJumps(int[] obstacles) {
        dp = new int[obstacles.length][3];
        dp[0][0] = 1;
        dp[0][1] = 0;
        dp[0][2] = 1;
        for(int i = 1; i < obstacles.length; i++) {
            if(obstacles[i] != 0) {
                dp[i][obstacles[i] - 1] = inf;
                dp[i - 1][obstacles[i] - 1] = inf;
            }
            for(int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
                if(dp[i][j] == inf) {
                    continue;
                }
                dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i - 1][j], Math.min(dp[i - 1][(j + 1) % 3] + 1, dp[i - 1][(j + 2) % 3] + 1));
            }
        }
        return Math.min(dp[dp.length - 1][0], Math.min(dp[dp.length - 1][1], dp[dp.length - 1][2]));
    }
}
```

### complexity analysis
- time complexity `O(n)`
- Space Complexity `O(n)`

## Better solution

a solution with only `O(1)` space complexity
```Java
class Solution {
    int inf = Integer.MAX_VALUE - 1;
    public int minSideJumps(int[] obstacles) {
            int[] dp = new int[]{1,0,1};
            for(int obstacle : obstacles) {
                if(obstacle != 0) {
                    dp[obstacle - 1] = inf;
                }

                for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
                    if(i == obstacle - 1) continue;
                    dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], Math.min(dp[(i + 1) % 3], dp[(i + 2) % 3]) + 1);
                }
            }
            return Math.min(dp[0], Math.min(dp[1], dp[2]));
        }
}
```
